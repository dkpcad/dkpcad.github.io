<h3>UGRP Project Calls for Year 2020 </h3>
<p><b>Project 1</b>: V2X Sensing Framework and Resource Allocation Issues in Intelligent Transport System <br />
<b>Funding Agency</b>: DST-ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations)<br />
<b>Preferred start and end dates</b>: 1st February to 31st December-2020, can be extended as per requirement.<br />
<b>Project Code</b>: V2X01<br />
<b>Description</b>:<br /> The current proposed standards for the vehicular to vehicular (V2V) are Distance Short Range Communication (DSRC) and IEEE 1960. These standards are widely adopted in Europe and USA. It is likely to be a part of Indian Intelligent Transport System (ITS) policy too. In India, it is currently implemented in few cities for the electronic toll collection (ETC) but not for the ITS. The DSRC standard has six user channels and one control channel to provide communication between the vehicles. India has different type of landscape and vehicular traffic (heavily populated with two and four wheelers) in urban areas. In Indian context, the DSRC standard is insufficient to provide the wireless resources to establish the communication between the vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Based on such issues, the project will be going to address the different issues using Cyber Physical System, like feasibility of DSRC standards for V2V Communications in urban areas, low<i>high mobility constraints, Driver’s behavior and road condition alerts etc. One of the major objectives is to develop V2X cooperative sensing ML</i>DL framework based on primary activity statistics which can be helpful to improve dynamic resource utilization with individual vehicles.<br />

<b>Prerequisites</b>:  Probability and Statistics, Python, C<tt></tt>, Machine Learning (Not mandatory)<br /></p>
<p><b>Project 2</b>: Mathematical modeling and Applied Deep Learning for 5G-NR and Wi-Fi 6 <br />
<b>Funding Agency - Tentative</b>: DST-UKIERI and University of Washington - Seattle - USA <br />
<b>Preferred start and end dates</b>: 1st February to 31st December-2020, can be extended as per requirement.<br />
<b>Project Code</b>: XG01<br />
<b>Description</b>:<br /> Recently proposed Wi-Fi 6 is designed in a way that it can coexist with 5G-New Radio (i.e, using common channel when either is unused). Wi-Fi 6 is an ideal choice for indoor networks whereas 5G for outdoor networks. Study on the coexistence of 5G and Wi-Fi 6 is still in its infant stage. The objectives of this project are threefold. Firstly, create a 5G test-bed using software defined radios and then exploit various use cases of coexistence between 5G and Wi-Fi 6. The open-air interface will be used to define the 5G specification with current services and packet gateway.  Secondly, to carry out the analysis for the coexistence of 5G and Wi Fi 6 based on the Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11 ax) frame structure and validate it by conducting the simulations and through the empirical test-bed setup. Third, a resource allocation problem with dynamic sharing can be solved using Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) with mobile edge computing. An effective sensing mechanism can be developed using advanced learning framework like Knowledge Infused Learning and Knowledge Graph theory. <br />

<p><b>Project 3</b>: Applied Deep Learning for Quantum Satellites <br />
<b>Funding Agency- Tentative</b>: DST / SAC-ISRO <br />
<b>Preferred start and end dates</b>: 1st February to 31st December-2020, can be extended as per requirement.<br />
<b>Project Code</b>: QS01 <br />
<b>Description</b>:<br /> Designing of the physical layer of secure communication with the help of deep learning for future quantum satellite communication with the multiplicity of earth and satellite communication, satellite to satellite communication as an end-to-end process. Satellite to satellite and Earth to satellite communication are possible using free space optics (FSO) link and Quantum channel.  The proposed research will investigate the various alternatives of deep learning (DL) based quantum satellite communication for the physical layer. The objective of this project is to provide a fundamentally new model of quantum satellite communication system design as an end-to-end reconstruction task that seeks to jointly optimize physical layer component in a single process.  Using DL, we can reduce hardware imperfection and mathematically tractable model.  The main technical usage of this project will be the developments of an innovative set of methods for physical layer secure quantum satellite communication using deep learning. <br />
