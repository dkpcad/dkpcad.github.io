<b>Project 1</b>: Physical Layer Security for 5G and Beyond Networks <br />
<b>Project Code</b>: PLS<br />
<b>Description</b>:<br /> For data confidentiality, encryption is the primary method of ensuring secrecy. However, in some emerging networking architectures, issues of key management or computational complexity make the use of data encryption difficult. For Example, ad hoc networks, in which messages may pass through many intermediate terminals on the way from source to destination, and sensor or radio-frequency identification (RFID) networks such as might arise in the envisioned Internet of Things, in which the end devices are of very low complexity. Moreover, when the user is mobile (for vehicular networks), the management of exchanging the keys becomes even challenging. For these reasons, there has been considerable recent interest in developing methods for secure data transmission that are based on the physical properties of the radio channel.<br />  
Recently, the physical layer has gained a more prominent role on the security context of wireless networks due to its potentiality on providing more effective solutions to safeguard confidentiality and privacy for 5G‐and‐beyond networks. Physical‐layer security (PLS) techniques are recognized to offer powerful features that can complement and enhance cryptography‐based mechanisms, by considering the unique properties of wireless channels. Even though physical‐layer security has been intensively studied in the past decade, novel scenarios expected for future networks impose big challenges for the full acceptance of PLS techniques as a component of the security solutions of 5G‐and‐beyond networks.<br />  </p>
<p><b>Project 2</b>: AI enabled 6G Wireless Networks <br />
<b>Project Code</b>: AIxG<br />
<b>Description</b>: <br /> The modern networks are anticipated to connect billions of wireless devices due to the popularity of smartphones, wearable devices, and ubiquitous wireless sensors for various applications. In the last decade, the rapid deployment of massive devices and applications has caused a growing demand for wireless radio spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) was proposed to utilize the spectrum efficiently in an opportunistic way, which is evolved to be an intelligent radio that can change its transmitter parameters according to the interactions with the environment. CR network equips its users with cognitive capability to sense and gather information from the surrounding environment and with reconfigurability to rapidly adapt the operational parameters according to the sensed information. This can be formulated as a study problem of user: any user perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. To explore the study of intelligent agent, Artificial Intelligence (AI) defined as a machine mimics &ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as &ldquo;learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;problem solving&rdquo; is brought to use in CR networks, named AI-enabled Radio and Networks.<br />
The ultimate design goal of future wireless networks is to meet diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of end users. This calls for the network entities in nature to be cognitive of the network environment and autonomous in decision making, which can be easily accomplished by utilizing machine learning techniques (i.e., Machine learning<i>Deep learning</i>Reinforcement learning/ Federated learning) as a tool..<br />  </p>
<p><b>Project 3</b>: 5G Enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems <br />
<b>Project Code</b>: ITS<br />
<b>Description</b>:<br /> The 5G promise for ubiquitous communications is expected to be a key enabler for transportation efficiency. However, the consequent increase of both data payload and number of users derived from new Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) makes network management even more challenging; an ideal network management will need to be capable of self-managing fast-moving nodes that sit in the 5G data plane. Platooning applications, for instance need a highly flexible and highly efficient infrastructure for optimal road capacity. Network management solutions have, then, to accommodate more intelligence in its decision-making process due to the network complexity of ITS. <br />
Since the road traffic is experiencing a drastic increase, vehicular traffic congestion is becoming a major problem, especially in city environments throughout the state of Gujarat. Applications like traffic monitoring, emergency service route planning (like 108 ambulances), and emergency message broadcasting needs to be launched to enhance the efficiency of users on the road, applications. However, at the technological side, the high amount of information that can be generated and processed by vehicles will significantly increase message redundancy, channel contention, and message collisions, thus reducing the efficiency of message dissemination processes. The rationale of this proposal lies in the need to leverage the existing knowledge and to develop a dynamic resource sharing framework for intelligent transportation using 5G-NR based Cellular-Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X). Specifically, this proposal would focus on the analytical modelling for the coexistence between C-V2X and Wi-Fi 6, which doesn’t prevail in the existing literature. This proposal would also compute the activity statistics of the Wi-Fi users like on and off period duration, duty cycle, distributions of on and off period duration, their moments using machine learning/deep learning approach and exploit it to have fair spectrum sharing with the C-V2X users. This would indeed help to reduce the transmission latency of basic safety messages, traffic monitoring and blind spot detection which are the potential use cases of C-V2X. The proposed framework would be validated and substantiated by the low-cost simulation and empirical testbed setup.<br />  </p>
<p><b>Project 4</b>: Internet of Bio-Nano Things for Disease Monitoring<br />
<b>Project Code</b>: IoBNT <br />
<b>Description</b>:<br /> Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, with 46% of the total diseases worldwide. The current healthcare solutions often follow a reactive approach to treat a disease. i.e., the disease is treated only once its symptoms are noticed or identified. Thus, the mortality rate in cancer patients is high due to the time-lapse, delayed diagnosis, and late-stage representation. On the contrary, futuristic healthcare solutions demand a proactive approach such that it is possible to predict disease at a very early stage, ideally even before it starts the manifestation of their symptoms.<br /> </p>
<p>The datasets utilized by biotechnology researchers and medical practitioners for AI based disease diagnosis are either a medical image data or an OMICS data. However, such datasets are complex, patient-specific, and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Cancer monitoring using such datasets is often at the cost of significant time-lapse and delayed diagnosis. In this context, this project would focus on proactive approach and aim to propose AI-enabled disease monitoring using molecular communications (MC) over the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). The key idea is to monitor the change in biomarkers concentration with the aid of implanted bio-nanosensors, which indicates the presence of anomaly beyond the certain cut-off. Moreover, the existing analytical frameworks for disease monitoring using MC are unrealistic which doesn’t account uncertainties with molecular propagation, effect of ISI, and 3D modelling of the inhomogeneous microfluidic environment. Furthermore, the modulation, coding, and detection techniques for anomaly detection are based on several simplified assumptions regarding molecular propagation. In addition, the integration of intrabody networks with external networks, which is an important part of IoBNT poses severe challenges. In this context, this project will also develop a comprehensive set of analytical frameworks to characterize the impact of realistic models on the accuracy of disease monitoring and validate it by means of bio simulations using discrete event simulator.<br />  </p>
<p><b>Project 5</b>: Interdisciplinary Research: Behaviour Analytics using Fly model <br />
<b>Project Code</b>: IRBA <br />
<b>Description</b>:<br /> The project focuses to solve the real-life problems by building an interface of biology and engineering. In past 100 years, extensive research has been carried out to understand the fly behaviour under extreme environmental conditions like temperature, pressure and lightning. The researchers have prepared the policies, principles, models, strategies, and protocols to understand and predict the human physiology and psychology based on the fly behaviour. However, most of the research has covered the identification, and existence of neurological disorders in human and very few has focused on behavioural analytics. The behavioural analytics is highly important in which the masses of people are involved such as military. The military has to deal in the extreme environmental conditions. Therefore, this research will enable the link between behavioural properties of Drosophila melanogaster (A fly) and its impact on understanding the troop coordination in an armed force. As the social behaviour of earth living species is mainly categorized as dominance, collective flocking, collective group decision making, dominance, and aggression, the identification of this behaviour under some external forces needs an essential care. In the context of the troop or group of people, these behaviours decide the ability to stick or follow the protocols and application of on-time agendas which affects their survival. These highly impactful behaviours, if not studied well can limit the operations on the battlefield. Depending on the subject and seriousness of the operation, the coordination of the troop can be tactical or strategic. The tactical coordination is guided by the superior of the group or an army at the time of the battle. This ordination is also treated as a defensive way to stay in a battle or while in marching. Strategic coordination consists of several various groups having different services and guided by the superiors of each group. <br />  </p>
